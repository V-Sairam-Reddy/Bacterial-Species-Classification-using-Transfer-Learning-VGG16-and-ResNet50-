# Bacterial-Species-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning-VGG16-and-ResNet50-
Bacterial species are classified into 5 different classes using Transfer Learning. Transfer learning corresponds to using the pretrained model to use for our classification. Models are built on Pretrained VGG16 and ResNet50.
